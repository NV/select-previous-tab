# Select Previous Tab

Select previously opened tab by pressing Alt-Q (Ctrl-Q on Mac). The shortcut can be configured.

It's inspired by [clut-chrome-extension](https://github.com/harshayburadkar/clut-chrome-extension) but Select Previous Tab has:

- No tracking
- No excessive permissions
- Doesn't consume any memory when not used
- 30 lines of code instead of 300+
